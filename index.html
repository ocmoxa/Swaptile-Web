        <p>Every day, we spend most of our time on the bus or subway. We often surf social media, listen to music or
            think about something. Life goes by very quickly. There is a lot of stress and anxiety. So we created the
            game SwapTile - a swap puzzle. The game is simple, but it helps you to relax and train your brain. Instead
            of 15 minutes of social media, now we can complete a beautiful picture and forget about the life pressure.
        </p>
        <p>The main aim of the game is to find the original position of the puzzle pieces. The pieces shuffled before
            starting. We can swap the locations of any two pieces. A tip or a preview can help to assemble the original
            image.</p>
        <p>The game is simple, but it includes a volume gallery of beautiful, vivid, and artistic pictures. New pictures
            every day! We guarantee that you will be interested and not bored. When you choose an image, by the next
            step, you need to select the number of pieces and then start playing! You can continue the unfinished
            pictures at any time (both online or offline). It's just amazing, isn't it? The game is free. The paintings
            are also free to download and use. We sincerely thank the Unsplash website for allowing us to use the
            images. So if you love some pictures, you can press the "share" button to share with your friends or
            download the image!</p>
        <p>Our team spent a lot of time writing the application and testing it. We hope you will have a good experience
            using SwapTile.</p>
        <p>Please, enjoy the game!</p>
